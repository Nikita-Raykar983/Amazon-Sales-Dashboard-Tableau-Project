## Key Insights 
Generated ₹39.3M revenue from 59,245 units across 8 categories and 11 sizes.

🏆 "Set" category leads in both quantity and revenue, followed by Kurta and Saree.

📦 Majority of products are in Shipped status; some delivery issues like Returns and Lost in Transit exist.

👕 Sizes M, L, and XL are most in-demand; larger sizes (4XL–6XL) have minimal sales.

🗺️ Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu are top shipping states; Expedited delivery is more used in high-volume states.

🕒 Peak sales occurred in early April, with a dip in mid-May and a recovery at month-end.

🧾 Over 99% of orders are Non-B2B, mostly through Amazon.in.

📉 Categories like Blouse, Bottom, and Ethnic Dress underperform and may need re-evaluation.

 ## Final Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard offers a clear and interactive view of Amazon's sales data, highlighting product performance, shipping trends, and customer preferences. The analysis shows that the “Set” category, mid-range sizes (M, L, XL), and top states like Maharashtra and Karnataka are key drivers of sales.

The dashboard also reveals potential improvement areas such as delayed deliveries, low-performing categories, and limited B2B reach. By visualizing these insights, the dashboard helps businesses make informed decisions on inventory, logistics, and regional strategy to improve overall performance and customer satisfaction.
